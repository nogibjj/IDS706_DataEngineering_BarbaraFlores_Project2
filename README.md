## ðŸ“‚ Rust CLI Binary with SQLite

The objective of this project is to develop a Rust command-line application (CLI) that interacts with an SQLite database. This involves creating and manipulating the database, using GitHub Copilot, generating an optimized binary as a GitHub Actions artifact, properly configuring GitHub Actions to test, build, and lint the Rust code, and producing a high-quality demonstration video explaining and showcasing the project's functionality.












#### Rust
![Rust Performance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nogibjj/IDS706_DataEngineering_BarbaraFlores_Miniproject8/main/images/rust_performance.png)

The following table clearly shows the differences in execution times between Python and Rust. In both queries, Rust significantly outperforms Python in terms of speed, with execution times in microseconds (Âµs) rather than milliseconds (ms) as in Python. This highlights the efficiency of Rust in handling database queries compared to Python.

| Script | Query | Execution Time |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Python |   1   | 0.000310 seconds |
| Python |   2   | 0.000105 seconds |
| Rust   |   1   | 307.30Âµs seconds |
| Rust   |   2   | 100.10Âµs seconds |

Finally, Rust offers several advantages over Python, including higher execution speed, stronger compile-time safety to prevent common errors, more precise memory control, lower resource consumption, and the ability to compile code into stand-alone binaries, making it ideal for high-performance applications and embedded systems where efficiency and control are required. While Python is known for its ease of use and versatility, Rust provides a more robust and efficient approach for applications that demand uncompromised performance and security.
